Whew!  Bucky grew hungry when he spied the wood panelled walls of their tiny bedroom, but gagged when the narrator insisted that the “woman on-top” position \"help(s) quench her motherly instincts. “Man and Wife” was the first of several sex documentaries made by Matt Cimber (aka Matteo Ottaviano), Jayne Mansfield's final husband, who had previously directed his wife in Single Room Furnished ('68).",

He carried the Tigers to the 1981 Final Four in Philadelphia. Back then, the tournament included a third-place game, and that’s where the trouble started for Macklin. Just before the consolation game against Virginia, President Ronald Reagan was shot, and after the loss, Macklin was asked if the news might have affected the team. His response—”He’s no kin of mine”—was so blown out of proportion that he feared for his life. In this documentary, directed by Marc Kinderman for ESPN Films, Macklin looks back at the anxious times when he thought he might get hung for a different reason.",

Catering to this international jet set, Escoffier produced fabulous dishes that combined luxury and theatricality, elevating restaurant food to an art form. In a time of untold luxury and decadence, when money and pleasure combined like never before, he cooked and named dishes for all of London's society - from Queen Victoria and Bertie, the fun-loving Prince of Wales, to the most glamorous entertainers of the day - Oscar Wilde, the actress Sarah Bernhardt and opera singer Nellie Melba.",

The film that resulted from this series of tense encounters is absolutely sui generis in the history of cinema:  a 100% real-life thriller unfolding minute by minute before our eyes. Poitras is a great and brave filmmaker, but she is also a masterful storyteller: she compresses the many days of questioning, waiting, confirming, watching the world’s reaction and agonizing over the next move, into both a great character study of Snowden and a narrative that will leave you on the edge of your seat as it inexorably moves toward its conclusion.",

Where did it disappear to, and why? In the mid 2000s, filling the void left behind by Hollywood’s abandonment of illustrated movie posters, independent artists and galleries began selling limited edition, screenprinted posters – a movement that has quickly exploded into a booming industry with prints selling out online in seconds, inspiring Hollywood studios to take notice of illustration in movie posters once more.",
